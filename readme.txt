Enhances sites running BuddyPress and BadgeOS by joining users to one or more specified groups when they use a special Invite Code to join your site.

== Description ==

The Group Management Add-on for BadgeOS evolved because school districts wanted to build one BadgeOS site, set up various achievements and learning pathways for all students
and give principals and teachers the ability to manage only their student’s submissions. Group Management allows that!

While this was built specifically for schools we think this can work for any similar large group set up. Think about a company that has multiple departments, managers, and employees.
How about the Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts or 4H? A large group with a state-wide chapter (perhaps), a regional leader (more than likely), and a troop leader (definitely).
With the Group Management add-on your “School Admin” and “Teacher” can see all submissions (for verification or approval) and all reports of badges students have earned.
On the back end “School Admins” and “Teachers” can also issue to or revoke badges from students in their school or group.

**Note:** You will need to install the free [BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS")&trade; (version 1.4.8 or higher) to use the BadgeOS Group Management Add-on. You will also need the [BuddyPress plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/buddypress/ "BadgeOS") v1.7 or higher installed.

[Get the BadgeOS plugin](http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/badgeos/ "BadgeOS").

[BadgeOS](http://badgeos.org "BadgeOS")&trade; turns your WordPress site into an achievement, badging and engagement management system. Your users complete steps, demonstrate skills and knowledge, and earn digital badges. Easily define the achievements, organize the badge requirements any way you like, and choose from and combine a range of assessment options to determine whether each task or requirement has been achieved.

Create badges and set up the achievements to earn them. Badges are Mozilla OBI compatible and sharable via [Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly.com"), the free web service for managing and displaying lifelong credentials.

= Do you offer services to help us design, build or customize our BadgeOS site? =

See [examples](http://badgeos.org/about/sample-sites/ "Sample pojects") and learn more at: [http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/](http://badgeos.org/services/badgeos-customization/ "BadgeOS Customization").

= Where should I contribute code back to the project? =

Thanks for asking!  Please do share back code modifications or enhancements you make for inclusion in BadgeOS core or as add-ons. (Functions that are specialized for just some users are likely best as add-on plugins to BadgeOS. We can help figure that out with you.) Visit us on [GitHub](https://github.com/opencredit/badgeos "BadgeOS on GitHub") to share your code with the BadgeOS community.

= Credly is really cool. How can I learn more about it? =

[Credly](https://credly.com/ "Credly web site") is the universal way to recognize, store and share life's achievements. We've integrated Credly into BadgeOS because it's downright the easiest, most fun way to collect evidence of all your achievements in one place and then share them out when and where it matters most. There are a rapidly growing number of platforms and apps that are using the Credly "Open Credit" API to enable sharable badges; the BadgeOS WordPress integration is just one great example! Visit us [Credly.com](https://credly.com "Credly on the Web") to learn more or [contact](https://credly.com/contact "Contact us") us for guidance with using the free Open Credit API in your own projects or applications.
