# BadgeOS Group Management Add-on
Enhances sites running BuddyPress and BadgeOS by joining users to one or more specified groups when they use a special Invite Code to join your site.

## Description
The Group Management Add-on for BadgeOS evolved because school districts wanted to build one BadgeOS site, set up various achievements and learning pathways for all students
and give principals and teachers the ability to manage only their student’s submissions. Group Management allows that!

While this was built specifically for schools we think this can work for any similar large group set up. Think about a company that has multiple departments, managers, and employees.
How about the Girl Scouts or Boy Scouts or 4H? A large group with a state-wide chapter (perhaps), a regional leader (more than likely), and a troop leader (definitely).
With the Group Management add-on your “School Admin” and “Teacher” can see all submissions (for verification or approval) and all reports of badges students have earned.
On the back end “School Admins” and “Teachers” can also issue to or revoke badges from students in their school or group.
